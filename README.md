This repository demonstrates a common yet difficult-to-diagnose error in React Native development: linking issues with third-party libraries containing native modules.  The `RNThirdPartyBug.js` file showcases a scenario where an attempt to use a library with missing native links leads to runtime crashes or unexpected behavior. The solution, in `RNThirdPartyBugSolution.js`, shows how proper linking using React Native's tools resolves the issue.  This is an uncommon bug because the root cause varies greatly with the specific library involved.
