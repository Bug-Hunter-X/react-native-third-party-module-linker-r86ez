To solve this, ensure that you've correctly followed the installation and linking instructions for the specific third-party library. This typically involves running commands such as `react-native link` or using autolinking (if supported by the library).  Double-check your project's build settings, especially if you're using Android Studio or Xcode, to verify that the necessary native code is correctly integrated. If manual linking is required, refer to the library's documentation for exact instructions.  Also verify that your project dependencies are up-to-date and compatible with your current React Native version.
